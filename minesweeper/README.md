- **Flood fill algorithm** for revealing connected empty cells
- **Win/Loss detection** with game state management
- **Timer functionality** tracking game duration

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: 9×9 grid with 10 mines
- **Intermediate**: 16×16 grid with 40 mines  
- **Expert**: 30×16 grid with 99 mines

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Reveal cell
- **Right Click**: Flag/unflag cell (context menu disabled)
- **R Key**: Restart game
- **1/2/3 Keys**: Switch difficulty levels

### Visual Features
- **Authentic 3D-style cell borders** reminiscent of classic Windows Minesweeper
- **Color-coded numbers** (1-8) matching traditional Minesweeper colors
- **Custom graphics** for mines and flags drawn programmatically
- **Hover effects** for improved user experience
- **Game state overlays** for win/loss conditions
- **Real-time mine counter** and timer display

## 🏗️ Framework Assessment

### ✅ Framework Strengths

#### Architecture & Design
- **Modular Component System**: Clean separation between core engine, input, rendering, scenes, etc.
- **Scene Management**: Robust system for managing different game states and transitions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive EventBus system for decoupled communication
- **Error Handling**: Sophisticated logging and error management with different severity levels

#### Developer Experience
- **CLI Tools**: Easy project scaffolding with `hatch new <project>`
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant feedback during development
- **TypeScript-ready**: Comprehensive JSDoc typing for excellent IDE support
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based project configuration

#### Game Development Features
- **Input Management**: Unified handling of keyboard, mouse, and touch input
- **Grid Management**: Built-in coordinate conversion and grid utilities
- **Asset Management**: Flexible loading system for images, audio, and data
- **Rendering Engine**: 2D Canvas with camera support and DPI scaling
- **Tile Management**: Specialized system for tile-based games

### 🔧 Areas for Enhancement

#### Framework Gaps Identified & Resolved
1. **GridManager API Issues**: Fixed constructor parameter naming inconsistencies
2. **Import/Export Consistency**: Resolved module export patterns
3. **Template Updates**: Streamlined main.js for easier project setup
4. **API Documentation**: Corrected method names and usage patterns

#### Potential Future Improvements
1. **UI Component Library**: Built-in widgets for common game UI elements
2. **Animation System**: More robust tweening and animation utilities
3. **Audio Integration**: Smoother workflow for game audio
4. **Math Utilities**: Vector classes, collision detection helpers
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch gesture handling
6. **Performance Tools**: Built-in profiling and optimization helpers

## 🎯 Framework Suitability

### Excellent For:
- **2D Puzzle Games** (demonstrated with Minesweeper)
- **Grid-based Games** (Tetris, Match-3, Board Games)
- **Turn-based Strategy** games
- **Educational/Demo** projects
- **Rapid Prototyping** of game concepts

### Well-Suited For:
- **Simple Arcade Games**
- **Card Games**
- **Interactive Applications**
- **Data Visualizations** with game-like interactions

### May Need Extensions For:
- **Real-time Action Games** (would benefit from more built-in physics)
- **Complex RPGs** (would need additional state management)
- **3D Games** (framework is focused on 2D)

## 🚀 Running the Game

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js installed
2. **Start Development Server**: 
   ```bash
   cd hatch/minesweeper
   node ../bin/hatch.js dev
   ```
3. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 💡 Code Highlights

### Game State Management
```javascript
const GAME_STATE = {
    READY: 'ready',
    PLAYING: 'playing', 
    WON: 'won',
    LOST: 'lost'
};
```

### Mine Placement Algorithm
```javascript
placeMines(excludeX, excludeY) {
    // Ensures first click is always safe by excluding
    // clicked cell and 8 neighbors from mine placement
    for (let y = 0; y < this.difficulty.height; y++) {
        for (let x = 0; x < this.difficulty.width; x++) {
            if (Math.abs(x - excludeX) <= 1 && Math.abs(y - excludeY) <= 1) {
                continue; // Skip first click area
            }
            availablePositions.push({ x, y });
        }
    }
    // Randomly place mines...
}
```

### Flood Fill Algorithm
```javascript
revealCell(x, y) {
    // Reveal current cell
    cell.state = CELL_STATE.REVEALED;
    
    // If no neighboring mines, reveal all neighbors
    if (cell.neighborMines === 0) {
        for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
            for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
                this.revealCell(x + dx, y + dy);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
